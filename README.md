# Angular Reactive Workshop

For this workshop, we are going to build Redux state around the `projects` feature with NGRX.

## The Stack

### NRWL Workspace

A NRWL workspace contains one or all of you Angular projects and libraries. It creates a monorepo for your applications domains. Nx helps add extra layer of tooling that can help manage your enterprise applications.

### Angular Material

Angular Material is a UI library for Angular that gives you access to a modern material UI that works across web, mobile, and desktop applications with minimal custom CSS and setup.

### JSON Server

Creates a quick and simple way to mock out a backend REST service. We can then deliver some mocked out data in JSON format to make sure everything is working as expected once our real backend is connected.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will both boot up a data server on localhost:3000 and serve the frontend on localhost:4200.
